How To Define Functions
A function is a block of instructions that performs an action and, once defined, can be reused. Functions make code more modular, allowing you to use the same code over and over again.
Python has a number of built-in functions that you may be familiar
with, including:
print() which will print an object to the terminal
int() which will convert a string or number data type to an integer
data type
len() which returns the length of an object
Function names include parentheses and may include parameters.
In this tutorial, we’ll go over how to define your own functions to use
in your coding projects.
Defining a Function
Let’s start with turning the classic “Hello, World!” program into a
function.
We’ll create a new text file in our text editor of choice, and call the
program hello.py. Then, we’ll define the function.
A function is defined by using the def keyword, followed by a name
of your choosing, followed by a set of parentheses which hold any
parameters the function will take (they can be empty), and ending with a
colon.
In this case, we’ll define a function named hello():
