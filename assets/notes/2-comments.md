Comments
Comments are lines that exist in computer programs that are ignored by compilers and interpreters. Including comments in programs makes code more readable for humans as it provides some information or explanation about what each part of a program is doing.

In general, it is a good idea to write comments while you are writing or updating a program as it is easy to forget your thought process later on, and comments written later may be less useful in the long term


Comment Syntax
Comments in Python begin with a hash mark (#) and whitespace character and continue to the end of the line. Generally, comments will look something like this:

```python
# This is a comment
```

Because comments do not execute, when you run a program you will not see any indication of the comment there. Comments are in the source code for humans to read, not for computers to execute.
In a *“Hello, World!”* program, a comment may look like this:
```python
# Print “Hello, World!” to console
print("Hello, World!")
```


Inline Comments
Inline comments occur on the same line of a statement, following the code itself. Like other comments, they begin with a hash mark and a single whitespace character. Generally, inline comments look like this:
```python
[code] # Inline comment about the code
```

For example
```python
print("Hello, World!") # Print “Hello, World!” to console
```


Conclusion
Using comments within your Python programs helps to make your programs more readable for humans, including your future self.

Including appropriate comments that are relevant and useful can make it easier for others to collaborate with you on programming projects and make the value of your code more obvious
